<<Animated Player Mod>>
by thehippomaster21

The Animated Player Mod replaces the player model with one very similar, except better animated. New animations include
walking, jumping, climbing, eating, and much more!
Note that with some slight modifications, the new player model is compatible with all custom player textures. Take a
look at /mods/AnimatedPlayer/char.png inside this ZIP file for an example of the changes required.
Some specific face expression features can be disabled if you don't like how the default player's face looks by changing
the values in the config file. The config file is located in /.minecraft/config/ .



Installation
To install the mod, first install Minecraft Forge, which can be found at: http://files.minecraftforge.net/
Then, simply move the whole UNEXTRACTED mod zip file into the .minecraft/mods folder. If there is no 'mods' folder,
create a new one in the .minecraft directory.
